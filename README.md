# PuffWatch

## Description

This app is a data collector used in my thesis (https://github.com/thanasisKirmizis/thesis2020).

Its main purpose is to store the readings of the Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer of a smartwatch into binary log files 
that will later be analyzed to predict smoking movements.

It features a "Run/Pause" button, a "Start/Stop Smoking" button, as well as settings for the working frequency of the sensors.

It runs in Wear OS of SDK 23 and later.
